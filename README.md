# configs
My personal Bash configs (I spend way too much time on these)

### TMUX

#### Cool stuff
> **Send commands to all panes:** alt+f (toggle on and off)  
>> ![tmux2](https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/synchronize-panes.gif)   
#
> **Send command to current and last selected pane:** alt+r  
     Click on two panes to sync them up, then us alt+r to prompt for a command that will be sent
     to both.
#
> **Session cycling:** alt+{q,e}  
   Allows you to have multiple independent terminal workspaces without having to alt+tab between 
     every application when navigating between them. Eg; 
     start a tmux session, detatch with ctrl+b, d. Then start a new
     tmux session, switch between them quickly with alt+q (previous) or alt+e (next).

#### General re-binds
> **Pane resize:** alt+{up,down,left,right}  
**Pane switching:** alt+{w,a,s,d}    
**Vertical split:** alt+1  
**Horizontal split:** alt+2
