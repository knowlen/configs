# configs
My personal Bash configs (I spend way too much time on these)  


#### TMUX

##### Cool stuff
> **Send commands to all panes:** alt+f (toggle on and off)  
**Send a command to current + last active pane:** alt+r  
**Session cycling:** alt+{q,e}  
    _    -Helpful if you're in the habit of leaving rougue sessions open (easy to detect old sessions).   
    -Allows you to have multiple independent terminal workspaces without having to alt+tab between 
     every application when navigating between them.
     Start a tmux session, detatch with ctrl+b, d. Then start a new
     tmux session, this command allows for quick cycling between the sessions._

##### General re-binds
> **Pane resize:** alt+{up,down,left,right}  
**Pane switching:** alt+{w,a,s,d}    
**Horizontal split:** alt+1  
**Vertical split:** alt+2
